Bennett to Shivam Dube, out Caught by Ish Sodhi!! "Inexperience showing" mutters VVS Laxman on air. Double strike for New Zealand as Dube, who looked out of sorts has to walk back to the dug-out.

New Zealand are pulling it back as both the openers are back in the shed. Rohit c Southee b Bennett 65(40) [4s-6 6s-3]
